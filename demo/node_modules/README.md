# THIS FOLDER IS A HACK -- REQUIRED FOR DEMO ONLY

_Symlinks above are just a hack to avoid duplicated modules for the runtime,
required by react, webpack and some others._

You won't have to do this in the real world, since deps will be at the right
place by default.

**This symlinks are related to this particular setup and is not necessary in a
normal setup.**

The demo of this module use the module itself which is a level above it, which
will never happen in real world, since you will use statinamic as a dep (so in
your `node_modules` folder).
